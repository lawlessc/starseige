I didn't really have any plans or an idea of what i would consinder "done", which is probably my progress was sporadic and lopsided( for me graphics was more fun than trying to come up with actual gameplay )
Some features:

             *Orbits for satellites are done using conic sections(this was made from C code for finding tangents to cones)
             *The planet has a thin atmosphere, done using someone else shader re-implented to get working on Android
             *launchable satellites , they look like stars, that fire lasers at incoming enemies.
             *Buttons are drawn using textures and shaders for signed distance fields.
             *planet textures are done with a perlin noise texture(not mine)
             *city lights on the plants nightside are also done using procedural noise in shader textures.
             *City lights, lasers and the aura have a glow effect.
             *A radar mode that gives everything a monochrome CRT look(i think i was playing DEFCON a lot when i decided to implement this)
             *An aura borealis and an aura australis
             *I was also trying to use GLSL to code changing cloud textures.
             *some newer files are using Kotlin as i was trying to learn that also when it came out.
